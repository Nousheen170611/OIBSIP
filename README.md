 Formula Used:
BMI=Weight(kg)/[Height(m)]^2
Example:
If your weight is 60 kg and height is 1.65 m,
BMI=60/(1.65)^2=22.04

Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

Installation:
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BMI-Calculator.git
Navigate to the project folder
cd BMI-Calculator

Run the program:
python bmi_calculator.py

 Example Output
Enter your weight in kilograms: 58
